# SADYCOS
SADYCOS is a simulation environment for satellite dynamics and control algorithms implemented in MATLAB Simulink.
It features a structure that allows for a highly customizable creation and execution of satellite simulations.
A constantly expanding library of models is provided to enable the user to quickly set up new simulations.
By implementing custom models and controllers, the user is in charge of making an own trade-off between simulation speed and level of detail.

# Documentation
The documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://sadycos.github.io/sadycos/).
There, you will find a [Quickstart Guide](https://sadycos.github.io/sadycos/content/quickstart.html) to help you set up SADYCOS and run a first simulation.

# Development
SADYCOS is developed by the Institute of Flight Mechanics and Controls within the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering and Geodesy at the University of Stuttgart.
For more interesting projects, visit the institute's [Github organization page](https://github.com/ifrunistuttgart) and [website](https://www.ifr.uni-stuttgart.de/en/).
